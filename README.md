# Context

I like to update my personal website, this is the v6. I hope I will keep this version as long as possible.

The goal of this version was to avoid the usage of external librairies (JS and CSS). That's why I only used VueJS (and vue-router) for the javascript part, and **no** css framework. No bootstrap, no tailwind, nothing.
It was a challenge, I wanted to test my skills with vanilla scss.

# Design

For the design, I decided to make minimalist,with some Notion vibes. I hope this is a success.

The website is available in both themes dark and light. It just follows your system.

# Benchmarks

I tried to increase the DevTools' lighthouse score as higher as possible. I got a perfect score in **Accessibility**, **Best practices** and **SEO**. I got troubles with **Performance**, which is very good but not perfect. (99% on Resume ðŸ¥µ)
