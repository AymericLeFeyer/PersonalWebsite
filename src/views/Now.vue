          Here would be ideal to write something inspiring, which reflects my
          mindset and represents my personality.

        <p>
          But I have no idea what to write here. I still have a lot to learn,
          the journey has only just begun.

          Every day is a new adventure where I meet new people with whom I do
          part of this ride.

        I discovered
        <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Three.JS</a
        >, a 3D modelisation javascript library. I started to follow the

        <a class="link" href="https://www.pit.fr" target="_blank">Pit</a>. I
        think this time it was better, but I still have a lot to learn to give a
        good talk.

        I attended to the
        <a href="https://devfest.gdglille.org/" target="_blank" class="link"
          >Devfest LILLE</a
        >
        with <a class="link" href="https://www.pit.fr" target="_blank">Pit</a>.
        We had the opportunity to watch a lot of talks about the latest
        technologies, and to meet a lot of people from the community.

        I obtained my master's degree in computer science at
        <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/" target="_blank" class="link"
          >Universit√© de Lille</a

        myself.

      <li>
        I created my first

          >blog</a
        >
        to share my knowledge and my discoveries about web and mobile
        technologies. I made it with
        <a href="https://notion.so" class="link" target="_blank">Notion</a> to
        have a nice design and to facilitate the writing and the maintenance.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started a permanent contract at
        <a class="link" href="https://www.pit.fr" target="_blank">Pit</a> as a
